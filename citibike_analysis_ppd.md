# NYC City Bike Analysis
For my analysis of a potential bike share program for Des Moines, I segmented the NYC Citi Bike share program data to see what observations could be made while also considering what is both similar and different about the two distinct cities. Using the NYC insights shaped how the Des Moines program could be similarly successful albeit on a smaller scale.

## Citi Bike Des Moines’ messaging should be targeted toward the local population
Summer months attract hordes of domestic and international visitors to New York City to experience the sights and sounds of all the greatest city on earth has to offer. Even so, visitors (i.e. “Customers”) take fewer than 25% of the number of rides during August 2018. Even at a time when visitors number the greatest, their contribution to the success of Citi Bike NYC is less critical.

## Citi Bike Des Moines should focus on attracting the business commuter
Far and away, the highest volume of rides taken are during peak business commute hours (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM) in New York City. During weekdays, demand usage drops dramatically during the midday and after-work. Weekend use is much more uniform during the daylight hours as both locals and visitors use bikes to get around. In a dense urban environment like NYC, many residents lack personal automobiles and options for getting around are plentiful (cab, bus, train, ride-share, bike, walk, etc.).
This fundamental difference when comparing to Des Moines does not imply that a Bike Share program is only for dense urban cities. Currently over 80k people are employed at downtown Des Moines businesses (1). This makes for a ripe opportunity to target those individuals as future City Bike Des Moines Subscribers as their adoption will ensure continued success to build upon.

## New Yorkers and Des Moinsers value their time and being outdoors
The average New Yorker spends 32 minutes getting to work. Historically the evening commute tends to take longer for a myriad of reasons. The average bike share ride duration for Subscribers (i.e. locals) is 13 minutes (2). If we agree that many of these trips are taken during work commute hours, then these subscribers are spending over 40 minutes LESS per day dealing with a commute than their non-biking peers. Furthermore, for many, this can represent valuable fitness and outdoor time that may otherwise would not be obtained.

Granted Des Moinesers lacks many of the traffic woes of a big dense city, but that doesn’t mean they want to spend valuable time in their car or in a slow bus or in traffic. The average Des Moineser spend over 19 minutes getting to work. While it’s unexpected that biking to work will save time for our locals, the health benefits, the enjoyment of being outside and the greater commute predictability are common traits regardless of metropolitan.

## Customers (versus Subscribers) can’t be ignored
In NYC, nearly 80% of August rides were completed by Subscribers, who are people who have purchased a monthly/yearly pass. Customers are typically visitors who may only complete one or a few ride during a trip or a local who doesn’t envision using the bike share program that frequently. Regardless, the smaller population Customer is immensely valuable for several reasons. 
### In many NYC locations, customer trips represent >80 of the activity (Central Park, High Line, World Trade Center). 
Des Moines may lack the volume of attractions as NYC, but placing bike racks at popular destinations such as Wells Fargo Arena, the Downtown Farmers Market, the Science Center and the Zoo (3) would provide attractive alternatives to another trip in a car and navigating a frustrating parking lot. 
### Bike Share programs are not limited to major Metros.
While many people will experience their first bike share in Paris, London, NYC, Chicago, Washington DC, they are not limited to major metros. Visitors to those cities who have enjoyed a bike share are likely to be open to trying a bike share when spending time in Des Moines either as a local or a visitor. Furthermore, smaller cities like Chattanooga has witnessed success in their program despite having a smaller footprint and fewer attractions than cities like Atlanta, Charlotte or Nashville (4). 

# Future considerations and additional analysis
## NYC and Des Moines weather can bike riding challenge sometimes
Both cold weather, rain, snow are not uncommon occurrences in both locales. Additional research on storage, maintenance, etc. for inclement weather.
## Education is necessary
As bikes become more plentiful on city streets, both drivers and nascent biker need education on safe distances, commutes and proper riding. (5)
## Even perfect dock placement can be a challenge if there is a dramatic supply/demand imbalance
Des Moines population density is 2.5/sq mile is not dense like NYC (70k/sq. mi)with multi-floor high-rise apartment buildings and commercial buildings. Even if a dock is placed at perfect intersection if more bikes are needed than available or if no vacant dock exists at the end of a ride, frustrations can mount for users. Major transit thoroughfares (non-highway) and bus routes may be viable options for residential dock stations to attract bus-commuters to start with. (6,7)
